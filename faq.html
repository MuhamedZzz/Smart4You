          <h5>What does FRP Lock mean?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Google introduced the Factory Reset Protection, also known
            as the Google account lock, as a safety measure for all Android devices.
            This feature was designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
            information in the event that the device is lost or stolen. However,
            it has become a common issue for those who have lost access to their
            account, received a second-hand phone, or simply forgotten their
            login details. Upon attempting to reset the device, a verification
            prompt will appear, and failure to fulfill it means that access
            to the device is not possible. The only solution is to remove
            the Factory Reset Protection.

          <h5>What's the estimated time of the process?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Completion of a typical Google verification bypass/FRP removal takes 5 minutes or less, subject to the speed of your internet connection.

          <p>
            To proceed with the process, you will need the following:

            -A Windows or Mac computer to download the necessary software.
            -A stable internet connection.
            -A USB cable.

          <p>
            Our software is guaranteed to be free of viruses. In contrast, some USB Redirector software offered by unreliable companies might contain malware that could gather your personal information, including search history, in some cases. Rest assured that we have no interest in your data and that the only information we have access to is the device port and computer name. All other actions are performed on our end of the computer and then transferred to your phone.
